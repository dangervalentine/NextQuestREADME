Each game can be categorized into one of five statuses:

| Status        | Meaning                            |
|---------------|------------------------------------|
| 🎯 Ongoing     | Currently being played             |
| 📚 Backlog     | Planned for future play            |
| ✅ Completed   | Finished and archived              |
| 🔍 Undiscovered| Available for discovery            |
| ⏸️ Dropped     | Started but no longer active       |

Each category supports:
- Ratings
- Notes
- Priority settings
